## General Information

- **Project Background**  
  This project focuses on predicting the demand for bike rentals in urban areas. By understanding the factors influencing bike rental numbers, the company can better manage their fleet and ensure bikes are available when needed most. The data comany gave was before Covid-19. Company want to know which are main factor to increase the rental number after lockdown is removed, so that cover their loses during lockdown.

- **Business Problem**  
  The business aims to predict how many bikes will be rented based on factors like temperature, weather, season, and time of day to help in resource planning, such as bike maintenance and distribution.

- **Dataset**  
  The dataset consists of bike rental data, including factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, and time of day. The target variable is the total number of bikes rented for a given time.

### Conclusions

- **Temperature and Weather Impact**: Higher temperatures correlate with more bike rentals, and better weather conditions (clear skies) lead to more demand.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Spring and summer months show higher rental demand than fall or winter.
- **Weekday vs. Weekend Trends**: Bike rentals are higher during weekdays, especially for working individuals, compared to weekends.
- **Weather Variables**: Wind speed and humidity negatively affect bike rentals, with lower rentals on windy or rainy days.

  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn
  - statsmodels
- **Jupyter Notebook** for executing the analysis
